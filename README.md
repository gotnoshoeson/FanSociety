FanSociety Manifesto

Musicians want to DIY their careers. Fans want to support them. We aim to bridge this gap by allowing musicians to publish a smart contract that will raise funds through NFT sales in a generational pattern. Instead of assigning value to NFT holders randomly, we proposed a generational/time based assignment of value.

Typically musicians only make money from live shows. The label takes a cut of everything else that they sell, merchandise, CDs, vinyl and digital downloads. The latest technology in music consumptio is a double edged sword. Streaming platforms provide an inexpensive way for musicians to make their tracks availabel to the entire world at an extremely low monthly rate for consumers. This however has led to a decline in sales for musicians and income from streaming royalties is incredibly low. 

The hardest part of making a career as a musician is startup capital. Wether for a tour or recording a decent first album, musicians need a lump of cash. Typically this is provided by record lables but comes at the cost of giving away partial ownership of the musician's intellectual property rights and splitting sales of various forms of revenue generation with labels. As DIY musicians ourselves, we've envisioned a better way. Why not crowd fund the startup capital form the band's first biggest fans?

Music lovers relish in being among the first to discover a new band. Now they can prove when they started listening with an NFT. By purchasing an NFT they can show their support, bet on the success of the band and receive perks at the band's discretion years into the future. Think of a band you've been listening to for years. Wouldn't it be cool if you could win backstage passes because you were one of their earliest fans and supporters?

We see this as an open platform where musicians can decide how they want to reward their supporters. Suggested ways to show thanks might be: raffling tickets to shows, exclusive limited edition vinyl pressings, merchandise giveaways, and eventually gated content to streaming music services such as alternate versions of tracks or early access to new releases. We feel very strongly that musicians should NOT promise to share a percentage of their earnings with NFT holders. This would merely shift the sharing of income from labels to a group of individuals and taint the future that we envision as well as possibly be classified as a security investment which would bring a whole mess of problems into the equation.

Record labels have long been seen as a necessary evil. We're ready to bury that notion and provide DIY musicians a DIY solution to startup capital.
